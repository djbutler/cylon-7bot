Welcome to Polymer Starter Kit Light!

To begin, fire up a local server from inside the `app` directory. Please make sure to serve up the contents of the directory rather than root as routing will otherwise fail to correctly function.

## Firing up a server using Python

If you are a Windows/Mac/*nix user, install Python 3 and from inside the `app` directory run:

```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

or if you have Python 2 already installed (typically available on Mac/*nix), you can run:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

You can of course also use WAMP or an alternative tool for serving up content.
