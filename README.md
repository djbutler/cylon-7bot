## Cylon 7bot

Cylon 7bot is a GUI and Javascript interface for controlling the 7bot robot arm. It's completely unofficial, so use at your own risk.

### Installation 

#### Part I: Installing firmware on your 7bot

1. Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) version 1.6 or greater.
2. Install support for the Arduino Due by opening `Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager` and installing `Arduino SAM Boards`.
3. Connect the 7bot to your computer via the USB cable.
4. Select the Arduino Due board by clicking `Tools -> Board -> Arduino Due (Programming Port)`.
5. Install the firmware by opening `File -> Examples -> Firmata -> StandardFirmata`, and pressing the `Upload` button.

#### Part II: Installing Cylon 7bot on your computer

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Run the following commands in the terminal (the last line may take a while):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/djbutler/cylon-7bot.git
    cd cylon-7bot
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

For a super simple demo, run:

```node simple-demo.js```

The arm base should rotate back and forth between 45 and 135 degrees.

For a slightly more interesting demo, run:

```node app.js```

and in another terminal, run:

```
cd frontend/app
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the app in action. You can control the angle of each joint by moving a slider.

#### Troubleshooting

You may have to change the serial port name, which is currently hard-coded in `app.js`. To find out the name of your serial port, one useful tool is [Gort](http://gort.io/). Once you've installed Gort, you can run `gort scan serial` to get a list of your serial connections. Try a few until you find the right one!
